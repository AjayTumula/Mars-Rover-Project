# Mars-Rover-Project
Overview

This repository is an implementation of Mars Rover Kata. The main goal of this project is to move Rovers on the surface of the Mars. The surface of the mars is considered
as a rectangular grid. The rovers move on the surface are based on the instructions provided by the user and the initial input is provided by the user. Many vehicles like
rovers and robots move on the Mars surface. They move left, right, and move forward based on the user's instruction. The position of the rover is described by the x,y coordinates and the four cardinal
compass points such as N,S,W,E which represent the North, South, East, and West directions.
